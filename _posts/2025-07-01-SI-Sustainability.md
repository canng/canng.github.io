I am currently editing a Special Issue for Sustainability on **"Designing Resilient Cities: Landscape-Based Architecture and Green Space Strategies for Urban Sustainability"**, together with:

🔹 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cNYcVQ0AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Nigel K. Downes </a> (Can Tho University, Vietnam)

🔹 <a href="https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/de/personen/kontaktseite/olabisi-obaitor-4e3afe23.html">Dr. Olabisi S. Obaitor</a> (LMU Munich, Germany)

This SI explores how landscape architecture, green space planning, and urban nature can contribute to climate-responsive, sustainable, and equitable urban development, particularly across the Global South. 

We welcome contributions on green-blue infrastructure, nature-based solutions, urban informatics, and interdisciplinary approaches to advance urban climate resilience and social equity.
