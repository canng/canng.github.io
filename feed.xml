This study addresses the challenges posed by inconsistent spatiotemporal biodiversity data by developing a time series of <strong>biodiversity loss footprints</strong> based on <strong>Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)</strong>. Numerous land use, land cover, and auxiliary datasets were integrated to produce a consistent time series of high-resolution harmonized land use (HHLU) maps. These maps were utilized to quantify spatial BII using linear-mixed effect models. Biodiversity intactness loss (BII footprint) was subsequently attributed to specific crops and livestock commodities. This study provides comprehensive global datasets, including HHLU and BII maps, and synthesized BII footprints across <strong>14 biomes, 193 countries and territories, 154 crop items, and 9 livestock</strong> categories from 2000 to 2020. These datasets facilitate spatiotemporal analyses to identify trends and patterns in global biodiversity integrity and biodiversity footprints, thereby elucidating the ecological trade-offs embedded in international trade. These insights can encourage appropriate interventions to transform consumption patterns and supply chains toward the effective conservation of global biodiversity.</p> <p><br/></p> <blockquote> <p style="font-size:15px"> <b>Nguyen, C.

However, the classification of <strong>tropical fruit tree species</strong> faces many technical challenges because of their identical leaf characteristics, especially in developing countries with limited accessibility to data and advanced technologies. This study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of currently available satellite images (<strong>Sentinel-2</strong> and <strong>Planet</strong>) and <strong>Gray-level co-occurrence matrix</strong> (GLCM) textural features in discriminating tropical fruit trees using a <strong>conventional neural network</strong> (CNN) compared to other machine learning algorithms. Spectral bands and textural features from Sentinel-2 and Planet images were extracted to input into the CNN model, as well as other five commonly used machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification results were evaluated based on performance metrics of accuracy, F1-score, and spatial agreement of classified maps. The contribution of each variable in the classification was identified using permutation feature importance. The research findings revealed that the CNN model outperformed the other machine learning models in detecting five major fruit trees (i.e., <strong>coconut, coconut intercropping, durian, pomelo, and rambutan</strong>). The most important contributions to mapping performance were constituted by spectral bands from Sentinel-2 (e.g., shortwave infrared-SWIR, Blue, and Vegetation Red-Edge bands), while Planet image provides vital textural information such as Entropy (ENT), Angular Second Moment (ASM), sum average (SA), and homogeneity (HOM). The research provides valuable insights into classifying tropical fruit trees using entirely free data sources, avoiding the need for costly and complex alternatives. It also presents significant potential for applications in other tropical regions, contributing to sustainable agricultural management.</p> <p><br/></p> <blockquote> <p style="font-size:15px"> <b>Nguyen, C.

This study analyzes LULC changes (LULCC) in Soc Trang Province, <strong>Vietnam Mekong Delta</strong>, from 2010 to 2020 and simulates future LULC for <strong>2030</strong> under four scenarios: <strong>natural growth (business as usual, BAU), climate change challenges, profit optimization, and adaptation strategies</strong>. Satellite-based LULC maps and geospatial datasets were integrated into a LULC simulation model based on a Markov Chain and Cellular Automata to predict LULC in 2030 under disparate scenarios. Simultaneously, this study also estimates economic values and ecosystem service values as proxies to evaluate benefits and trade-offs between the scenarios. The research findings reveal that the critical LULCC observed during 2010–2020 are transitions from triple rice crops to double rice crops, rice–shrimp to brackish aquaculture, and expansion of perennial plantations. These transitional trends will persist at a modest rate under the BAU scenario in 2030. The climate change challenge scenario will intervene up to 24.2% of the total area, with double rice crops reaching the most extensive area compared to other scenarios, about 106,047 ha. The profit optimization scenario will affect 16.03% of the total area, focusing on aquaculture expansion to the maximum shared proportion of 34% (approximately 57,000 ha). Adaptive solutions will emphasize reducing triple rice crops while expanding double rice crops and reviving rice–shrimp to different extents depending on development pathways. Economic evaluations show a growth trend across scenarios, with maximum returns under profit optimization. Yet, <strong>ecosystem service</strong> values notably highlight <strong>ecological trade-offs</strong>, raising concerns about balancing economic benefits and ecological trade-offs in land use planning. The research findings recommend a comprehensive and multitarget approach to land use planning that integrates ecosystem services into initial assessments to balance benefits and trade-offs in coastal areas commonly affected by LULCC. By adopting well-informed and strategic land use plans that minimize ecological and social impacts, local sustainability and resilience to climate change can be significantly enhanced.</p> <p><br/></p> <blockquote> <p style="font-size:15px"> Diep, N.
